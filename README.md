#A Hospital management where administrator can add patients, as they register and already registered patient can login using their PatientId.
Administrator has a separate login page, where if the adminId is given, it will login to admin's page where the admin can see already existing patients in the hospital and their details.
An Admin can edit the details of the patient(once they are confirmed of covid-19 or cured from it) and delete a patient if they are no longer admitted in the hospital.
I have build this application using HTML,CSS and Javascript for frontend and Java for backend.
Used JDBC for connectivity with MySQL database.
Step 1: open XAMPP and start MySQL
Step 2: open MySQL Workbench and create a database(my database is called jdbc-video) and tables(I have two tables here: admin and patients)
Admin is registered with id - 100
Patients table has columns namely: name, id, contact, age, covid, address
Step 3: Run the main function in MyJDBC.java file
Step 4: Fill the form
In the given video below, I have explained each and every process very clearly.
